# for-school
this is for my programming class i'm taking for my major Digital Manufacturing.
I have +3 years experience in manufacturing something and counting.
yes all of it hands on, using my actual muscles. this is a first for me in many ways but we will have to take it day by day
My name is Cody Flatt, I'm very brand new to all of this and trying to learn everyday
